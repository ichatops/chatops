## PRD Writing Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- **Be Specific:** Use concrete, measurable requirements
- **User-Centered:** Focus on user value and experience
- **Data-Driven:** Include research data and metrics
- **Collaborative:** Involve engineering, design, and stakeholders
- **Iterative:** Update PRD based on feedback and learnings
- **Traceable:** Link requirements to business objectives

### Don'ts ❌
- **Avoid Ambiguity:** Don't use vague terms like "user-friendly"
- **No Solution Jumping:** Don't assume technical solutions
- **Avoid Scope Creep:** Keep focused on core objectives
- **Don't Skip Research:** Always validate assumptions with data
- **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Start with MVP approach

## PRD Review Process

1. **Draft Phase:** Initial PRD creation by PM
2. **Stakeholder Review:** Engineering, Design, Business review
3. **Refinement:** Incorporate feedback and clarify requirements
4. **Final Review:** Executive and legal approval if needed
5. **Approval:** Sign-off from all stakeholders
6. **Implementation:** Development team execution
7. **Post-Launch Review:** Retrospective and lessons learned

## Templates and Tools

- **PRD Template:** Use the template in `prd/template.md`
- **User Story Template:** Follow the "As a... I want... So that..." format
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Use Given-When-Then format
- **Metrics Dashboard:** Link to analytics dashboards
